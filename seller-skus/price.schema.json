For example, if you have three shipping locations \"West Coast\", \"Central\" and \"East Coast\" and you set \"Price\" = 10.00 but you want to charge 11.00 for the Merchant SKU if it ships from your \"West Coast\" shipping location you would use \"West Coast = 11.00\" for FCPrice.  If you also wanted to charge 9.50 for the \"East Coast\" shipping location you would set West Coast = 11.00 | East Coast = 9.50 for FC Price

			##Logic
			
			'price' must be defined. 'fcPrice' only provides an override of the value set as 'price' for the merchantFCs referenced"
